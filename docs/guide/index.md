# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for [inertia_rails](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-rails) adapter for [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/).

## Why adapter-specific documentation?

The [official documentation for Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) is great, but it's not Rails-specific anymore (see the [legacy docs](https://legacy.inertiajs.com)). This documentation aims to fill in the gaps and provide Rails-specific examples and explanations.

## JavaScript apps the monolith way

Inertia is a new approach to building classic server-driven web apps. We call it the modern monolith.

Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without the complexity that comes with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side patterns that you already love.

Inertia has no client-side routing, nor does it require an API. Simply build controllers and page views like you've always done!

### Not a framework

Inertia isn't a framework, nor is it a replacement for your existing server-side or client-side frameworks. Rather, it's designed to work with them. Think of Inertia as glue that connects the two. Inertia does this via adapters. We currently have three official client-side adapters (React, Vue, and Svelte) and two server-side adapters (Laravel and Rails).
