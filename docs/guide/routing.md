# Routing

## Defining routes

When using Inertia, all of your application's routes are defined server-side. This means that you don't need Vue Router or React Router. Instead, you can simply define Rails routes and return Inertia responses from those routes.

## Shorthand routes

If you have a page that doesn't need a corresponding controller method, like an "FAQ" or "about" page, you can route directly to a component via the `inertia` method.

```ruby
inertia 'about' => 'AboutComponent'
```

## Generating URLs

Some server-side frameworks allow you to generate URLs from named routes. However, you will not have access to those helpers client-side. Here are a couple ways to still use named routes with Inertia.

The first option is to generate URLs server-side and include them as props. Notice in this example how we're passing the `edit_url` and `create_url` to the `Users/Index` component.

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render inertia: 'Users/Index', props: {
      users: User.all.map do |user|
        user.as_json(
          only: [ :id, :name, :email ]
        ).merge(
          edit_url: edit_user_path(user)
        )
      end,
      create_url: new_user_path
    }
  end
end
```

Another option is to use [JsRoutes](https://github.com/railsware/js-routes) or [JS From Routes](https://js-from-routes.netlify.app) gems that make named server-side routes available on the client via autogenerated helpers.
