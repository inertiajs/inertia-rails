## [3.4.0] - 2024-11-02

* Inertia Rails documentation (@skryukov)
* Add specs for config refactor (#139)
* New feature: if/unless/only/except options for inertia_share. Enables per-action sharing! (#137, @skryukov)
* Bugfix: for inertia errors when using message_pack to serialize cookies. (#143, @BenMorganMY)
* Test Rails 7.2 in CI/CD (#145, @skryukov)
* Bring redirect behavior in line with Rails 7.0 behavior (#146, @skryukov)
* Gemspec cleanup (#149, @skryukov)

## [3.3.0] - 2024-10-27

* Refactor Inertia configuration into a controller class method. Thanks @ElMassimo!
* Documentation updates. Thanks @osbre and @austenmadden!
* Further fixes to the `Vary` header. Thanks @skryukov!
* Add configuration option for the component path in the renderer.

## [3.2.0] - 2024-06-19

* Refactor the internals of shared Inertia data to use controller instance variables instead of module level variables that run a higher risk of being leaked between requests. Big thanks to @ledermann for the initial work many years ago and to @PedroAugustoRamalhoDuarte for finishing it up!
* Change the Inertia response to set the `Vary` header to `X-Inertia` instead of `Accept`, Thanks @osbre!
* Always set the `XSRF-TOKEN` in an `after_action` request instead of only on non-Inertia requests. This fixes a bug where logging out (and resetting the session) via Inertia would create a CSRF token mismatch on a subsequent Inertia request (until you manually hard refreshed the page). Thanks @jordanhiltunen!

## [3.1.4] - 2024-04-28

* Reset Inertia shared data after each RSpec example where `inertia: true` is used. Thanks @coreyaus!
* Update Github Actions workflows to use currently supported Ruby/Rails versions. Thanks @PedroAugustoRamalhoDuarte!

## [3.1.3] - 2023-11-03

* Depend on railties instead of rails so that applications which only use pieces of Rails can avoid a full Rails installation. Thanks @BenMorganMY!

## [3.1.2] - 2023-09-26

* Fix `have_exact_props` RSpec matcher in the situation where shared props are defined in a lambda that outputs a hash with symbolized keys

## [3.1.1] - 2023-08-21

* Fix broken partial reloads caused by comparing a list of symbolized keys with string keys from HashWithIndifferentAccess

## [3.1.0] - 2023-08-21

### Features

* Allow inertia to take over after initial pageload when using ssr. Thanks @99monkey!

## [1.12.0] - 2022-05-04

## [1.11.1] - 2021-06-27

* Fixed thread safety in the middleware. Thanks @caifara!

## [1.11.0] - 2021-03-23

* Added an install generator for Vue.

## [1.10.0] - 2021-03-22

* Added install generator to quickly add Inertia to existing rails apps via `rails inertia_rails:install:react`

## [1.9.2] - 2021-02-23

* Improve method for detecting whether a user used the RSpec helpers without adding `inertia: true` to the spec
* Emit a warning when expecting an Inertia response in RSpec and never reaching a `render inertia:` call

## [1.9.1] - 2021-02-10

* Define `redirect_to` and `redirect_back` as public methods for compatibility with other code using them

## [1.9.0] - 2021-01-17

## [1.8.0] - 2020-12-08

## [1.7.1] - 2020-11-24

* Fix the definition for InertiaRails::Lazy to avoid an uninitialized constant error when booting an application. 

## [1.7.0] - 2020-11-24

* Add support for "lazy" props while rendering. These are props that never compute on the initial page load. The only render during a partial update that calls for them explicitly.

## [1.6.0] - 2020-11-20

* Built in error sharing across redirects! adding `{ inertia: { errors: 'errors go here' } }` as an option in `redirect_to` will automatically feed an `errors` prop to whatever is rendered after the redirect.
* Set content type to json for Inertia responses
* Return the original response status with Inertia responses
